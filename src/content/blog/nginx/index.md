Hey there, web enthusiasts! Let's talk about Nginx, your digital Swiss Army knife. It's not just a web server; it's a load balancer, a reverse proxy, and so much more—all rolled into one!

## Getting Started: Setting Up Your Playground
First things first, let's get our hands dirty. Fire up your laptop and spin up a virtual machine (VM). Think of a VM as your own personal sandbox where you can experiment without risking your main system.

## Installation (Linux Users):
Open your terminal and type:
```Nginx
sudo apt-get update  
sudo apt-get install nginx
```

Let it install. Once it's done, let's see if it's working. Open your web browser and go to localhost:80 or simply localhost. You should see the "Welcome to nginx" page and some... well, stuff that might look a bit cryptic at first. Don't worry, we'll unravel it all together!

## Navigating the Configuration:
Now, let's dive into Nginx's configuration. Navigate to /etc/nginx. If you're wondering what this directory is, well, just Google it! (Just kidding... mostly!) Seriously though, this is where all the magic happens – it stores all of Nginx's configuration files. Think of /etc as the central hub for system-wide configuration, like the control room of your operating system. It's where essential settings for various applications and services are kept.

So, nginx.conf is stored here. After navigating, list all files using ls. You'll see a bunch of files. Don't panic! We'll look into them one by one.

First, open nginx.conf using your favorite text editor, like nano. You can't edit it directly unless you're a superuser (root). So, use:
```Nginx
sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```
You'll see a lot of... well, more stuff. Again, don't panic!

Let's start with the basics, the very first line of the file: the events block.

## Diving into the Configuration: The events Block - The Heartbeat of Nginx
Okay, so we're looking at nginx.conf, right? And we said we're going to break it down, block by block. Now, here's a fun question: if you had to pick the most essential block, the one that makes Nginx tick, which would it be?

... You guessed it! It's the events block.
Think of it like this: If Nginx were a human body, the events block would be its heart. Without a heart, well, you don't have much going on, right? Same goes for Nginx.
So, what exactly does this "heart" do?

Let's imagine you're throwing a huge party, and tons of people are trying to get in at the same time. You need someone at the door to manage the flow, right? That's what the events block does for Nginx. It manages the flow of incoming connections.

Here's the breakdown:

### Connection Management:
Nginx is built to handle a massive number of connections simultaneously. How? Well, the events block tells it how to do that.
It's like telling your party bouncer: "Hey, use this system to keep everyone organized!"

### Worker Connections:
Inside this block, you'll find worker_connections. This is like telling each of your party bouncers, "You can handle this many people at once!"
So, if you set worker_connections 1024;, each worker process (think of them as your bouncers) can handle up to 1024 connections.
### Connection Handling Methods:
Now, how do you manage those connections? Do you use a clipboard? A spreadsheet? A fancy computer system?
The events block tells Nginx which method to use. Common methods are epoll (super-efficient on Linux), kqueue (for BSD systems), and select (a simpler, but less efficient, method).
Nginx is smart; it usually picks the best one for your system.

### Other Directives: 
Like, who gets to open the door next? How many people do we let in at once? The events block manages these small details too.
Why is this so important?

Without it, Nginx would be like a party with no organization. Total chaos!
It wouldn't know how to allocate resources, leading to crashes and slowdowns.
The events block is how Nginx is able to deal with so many users at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
Let's get interactive:

Have you ever tried to open a website that was super slow? That could be a sign of a server not managing connections well.

Have you ever thought about how websites like Google or Facebook are able to handle so much traffic? The events block plays a huge role in that.

So, next time you see the events block, remember it's the heartbeat of Nginx, keeping everything running smoothly!

Does that make sense? Any questions? Let's keep this conversation going!

Alright, this events block is the heart of the system. What if the heart of a person is working and he isn't able to do things? Which organ fo you think has a problem? Yess, Exactly the brain Now here comes the brain 

## The http block

### Hosting Your Website: A Basic Setup
Let's say you've developed a website and want to host it. Here's a basic configuration:
```Nginx
http {
    location / {
        listen 80;
        root /path/to/your/static_site;
        index index.html;
    }
}
```


#### Important Note: Remember to use semicolons (;) after every line in the block.

Save this, and then run:
```Nginx
sudo nginx -t
```

This tests the configuration. If you get a success message, then congrats! Your configuration is successful! After that, we should reload Nginx so that the configuration applies. Use:
```Nginx 
sudo systemctl reload nginx.service
```

Now, you can go and check localhost:80. Wow, you've got a beautiful website! <br/>
Now, you might be wondering what just happened. Don't worry, let me explain.
```Nginx 
http {
    listen 80;
}
```

This tells Nginx to listen for all requests coming to port 80.
<br/>
And:
```Nginx
location / {
    root /path/to/your/project;
    index index.html;
}
```


This specifies that all requests coming to localhost:80 and starting with / should be responded to with index.html from your project.

### Handling MIME Types: Fixing CSS Issues
Now, you might encounter a problem: your styles aren't applying, and your browser's network tab shows your CSS file as a text file. How can this be?
<br/>

It's because you haven't specified the MIME types in the file. Remember when we did ls earlier? We saw a file called mime.types.<br/>

Yes, this is the solution! Take a look at the file. You'll see it specifies which request should have which type.

Now, include mime.types in nginx.conf: 
```Nginx
http {
    include mime.types;
    # ... your other configurations
}
```


Just use this, and they'll be included. Don't forget your localhost configuration in the above http block!

### Handling Routes: Multiple Pages (and Beyond!)

We've seen how to handle a basic route like `/about` within another `location` block. But what if you have *many* pages? Let's make things more organized and interactive!

**Scenario:** You have a website with pages like `/`, `/about`, `/contact`, `/products`, and `/services`. You want Nginx to serve the correct `index.html` from different directories for each page.
```Nginx
location / {
    root /path/to/your/project;
    index index.html;
    location /about {
        root /path/to/your/project/route;
        index index.html;
    }
}
```


Yes, you can write a location block inside a location block. All requests coming to localhost:80/ will be redirected to index.html of the home page, and all requests to localhost:80/about will be redirected to index.html of the about page.

**Challenge**: Go and search how to provide error files, IDs, and more. Try using different routes and configurations. If you have any doubts, feel free to ask!

### Reverse Proxy: Acting on Behalf of Others
What the heck is this? Think about attendance proxies you use for your friends in classes. Nginx does the same thing. Proxy is just a fancy word for doing something on behalf of others. So, what does Nginx do? Let's see. 

<br/>
Let's say you've made a dynamic website with a server and all that. You can't use localhost in production, so you've used a domain name. You want to redirect all traffic coming to your domain name to localhost.

<br/>
Yes, this is called a reverse proxy. Nginx is redirecting traffic to localhost instead of people directly accessing your localhost.

#### Here's how it works:
```Nginx
http {
    listen 80;
    server_name your_domain_name.com;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:your-server-where-backendisrunning;
    }
}
```
And that's it! Go to localhost:yourport and see your server's response. The location specifies that all requests starting with / will go to localhost:yourport.

#### Similarly, for your understanding:
```Nginx
location /api {
    # ...
}
```
This specifies that all requests coming to /api will be redirected to your server.
<br/>

This is all about reverse proxying.
<br/>

Please go and study about proxy_headers and some more about Nginx conf for reverse proxy. Feel free to ask doubts!

### Load Balancing: Handling High Traffic

Let's say after following all the Lambda sessions, you've made a beautiful website, and it's a huge hit! You're receiving enormous requests. How do you handle all that? This is where load balancing comes in.
<br/>


Yes, Nginx can be used as a load balancer too. Nothing much to do. Clone the project multiple times, run them on different ports, and:

```Nginx
http {
    upstream backend {
        server port1;
        server port2;
        server port3;
    }
}
```

Use this configuration, and that's it! Nginx manages load balancing. It equally divides the traffic into these three ports. 
<br/>
Let's say you have a good VM (don't think much about VMs; Lambda sessions will come soon if you don't know). If you want one specific port to handle more traffic, you can use the weight property provided by Nginx itself:


```Nginx
http {
    upstream backend {
        server port1 weight=2;
        server port2;
        server port3;
    }
}
```

In this way, port1 will handle more traffic.

### Other Nginx Capabilities: Beyond the Basics

#### Caching:
Imagine your website serves the same images or files repeatedly. Instead of fetching them from the server every time, Nginx can store (cache) them.

**Basic Explanation:** It's like having a handy shelf where you keep frequently used items. Nginx stores copies of static content (like images, CSS, JavaScript) and even dynamic content to speed up delivery.
This dramatically improves performance and reduces the load on your backend servers.
#### Security (SSL/TLS Termination):

Nginx can handle the encryption and decryption of secure connections (HTTPS).
**Basic Explanation:** When you visit a website with "https," your connection is encrypted. Nginx can take care of this encryption, freeing up your backend servers to focus on other tasks. This process is called SSL/TLS termination.
It protects sensitive data exchanged between users and your website.
It acts like a secure gateway, making sure all the information going in and out is scrambled so that no one can read it except for the server and the user.

#### Mail Proxy:
Nginx can act as a proxy server for email protocols like IMAP, POP3, and SMTP.
**Basic Explanation:** Just like it proxies web traffic, Nginx can also handle email traffic. It can sit between your email clients and your mail servers, managing connections and providing security.
This can be useful for load balancing and security in email infrastructure.
It's like a mailman that sorts and delivers your emails, but also checks for security.

#### Media Streaming:
Nginx can stream media content, such as videos and audio files.
**Basic Explanation:** It can efficiently deliver large media files to users, supporting various streaming protocols.
This makes it ideal for hosting video and audio content.
It's like a dedicated channel for your videos and music, delivering them smoothly to your audience.
